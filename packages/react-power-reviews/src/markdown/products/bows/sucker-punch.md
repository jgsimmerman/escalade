**This bow is an escape from the daily grind.** It was made for fun. Light and perfectly balanced with 50-pound peak draw interchangeable draw modules, adjustable draw length, and 60% draw- specific let off, it provides smooth, easy shooting for as long as it takes to clear the weight of everyday responsibilities from your shoulders. Deep cam grooves prevent derailment while swatting through sedge or banging around the boat bottom, so itâ€™s always ready to go and never lets you down. The specialized Sucker Punch looks, feels, and shoots like it was made for you alone, built for times when you answer to yourself.

## RTF package includes:
