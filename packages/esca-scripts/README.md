# esca-scripts

Reusable CLI scripts for devops.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add esca-scripts
```

## Usage

For usage, run `esca-scripts --help` or [view help in source](https://github.com/escaladesports/esca-scripts/blob/master/src/help.js).

## Dependencies

If you're targeting anything that isn't the browser, you will also need to install `babel-runtime` as a dependency. While this is installed in `esca-scripts`, it won't be available to you in production if you install `esca-scripts` as a devDependency.
